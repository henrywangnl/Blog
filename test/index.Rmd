I have been writing a few posts about R on my blog and are getting annoyed with the workflow back and forth between RStudio and WordPress. Overall, the previous workflow has two main pitfalls making me frustrated:   

- **R Code**

Coping R code from RStudio and pasting it to WordPress can take me much time. Code highlight is also challenging, although eventually I figured out that the plugin of [SyntaxHighlighter Evolved](https://wordpress.org/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/) did a great job.

- **R Output**

Often I need to export R outputs (e.g., ggplot2 plots) and upload to WordPress, sometimes formatting them a bit.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

firsts <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-06-09/firsts.csv')
firsts
```

```{r}
ggplot(firsts, aes(year, category, color = category)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1730, 2020, 10),
                     expand = c(0.015, 0.975)) +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = NULL,
       title = "African American Achievements") +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "black"),
        plot.title = element_text(color = "white",
                                      margin = margin(t = 10)),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "black"),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "white", size = 0.1, linetype = "dotted"),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_text(color = "white"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -60, vjust = 1, hjust = 0),
        axis.title = element_text(color = "white"))
```
