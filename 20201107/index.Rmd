Here is a lookup table of HubSpot's default contact properties.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figs", "hubspot.jpg"))
```

I have been working on HubSpot data analysis with R on a daily basis and having a good understanding of contact properties can save me a lot of time. HubSpot provides the [properties CRM api](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/crm/properties) for developers to get the contact properties list and also provides the explanations of all the default contact properties: [https://knowledge.hubspot.com/contacts/hubspots-default-contact-properties](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/contacts/hubspots-default-contact-properties).

`r goodpress::read_more()`
However, sometimes I find it a bit difficult to `guess` which property I should use to answer a question because the internal names of those properties are not that explicit. For example, `Marketing emails opened` is the property I should use to track the number of marketing emails a contact has opened but it took me a while to figure out the internal name is called `hs_email_open`. Therefore, I need a lookup table to show these information:

* `name`: the internal name for data analysis, which is like variable name in a data frame;
* `label`: the label name on HubSpot platform, which is easy to remember;
* `description`: more information about a property;

Feel free to use it but please be aware that these are just the default contact properties from my [test developer account](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/creating-test-accounts). As such, please check [HubSpot API](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/crm/properties) if you want to have a full list of all your properties.

If you like you can use my R code below:

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)

base_url <- "https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3"
key <- "<Your HubSpot API Key>"

data <- paste0(base_url, "/properties/contacts?hapikey=", key) %>%
  GET() %>%
  content(as = "text") %>%
  fromJSON(flatten = TRUE)

contact_properties <- data$results
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
load("contact_properties_lookup.rda")
knitr::kable(contact_properties_lookup %>% select(name, label, description),
             caption = "HubSpot's Default Contact Properties List")
```
