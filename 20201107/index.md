Here is a lookup table of HubSpot's default contact properties.

I have been working on HubSpot data analysis with R on a daily basis and having a good understanding of contact properties can save me a lot of time. HubSpot provides the [properties CRM api](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/crm/properties) for developers to get the contact properties list and also provides the explanations of all the default contact properties: <https://knowledge.hubspot.com/contacts/hubspots-default-contact-properties>.

However, sometimes I find it a bit difficult to `guess` which property I should use to answer a question because the internal names of those properties are not that explicit. For example, `Marketing emails opened` is the property I should use to track the number of marketing emails a contact has opened but it took me a while to figure out the internal name is called `hs_email_open`. Therefore, I need a lookup table to show these information:

-   `name`: the internal name for data analysis, which is like variable name in a data frame;
-   `label`: the label name on HubSpot platform, which is easy to remember;
-   `description`: more information about a property;

Feel free to use it but please be aware that these are just the default contact properties from my [test developer account](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/creating-test-accounts). As such, please check [HubSpot API](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/crm/properties) if you want to have a full list of all your properties.
